# 🚀 Tour to Chernobyl

Welcome to my repository for the <strong>Tour to Chernobyl</strong> project! This project was created as part of my studies in the <em>Advance CSS</em> course on Udemy, and it serves as a repository for the site I built during the course.

## 🌎 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to store the Tour to Chernobyl project so I can use its components in future projects or share it with recruiters when I decide to find work.

## 🖥️ Technology

The Tour to Chernobyl project was built using <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, without any <strong>JavaScript</strong> (as required by the course project specifications). In the course, I also learned how to use <strong>SASS</strong> to improve my CSS workflow.

## 💡 Features

Some notable features of the Tour to Chernobyl project include:

- 🎨 A stunning visual design that incorporates striking imagery and typography to create a unique and immersive experience for users.
- 🎥 Effective use of CSS animation techniques, such as using <code>transform</code> and <code>transition</code> to create smooth and visually appealing animations for rotating images and other elements.
- 🔮 Innovative use of the <code>clip-path</code> property to create interesting and unusual shapes for various elements on the page, adding a distinctive and memorable touch to the site's design.
- 💪 Advanced layout techniques that demonstrate a deep understanding of CSS, including creative use of <code>float</code> and <code>position</code> to achieve precise and visually pleasing layouts without relying on modern CSS frameworks like Flexbox or Grid.
- 📦 A robust and well-organized SASS codebase, with well-structured stylesheets and efficient use of mixins and variables to keep the code concise and maintainable.


## 🚫 Limitations
