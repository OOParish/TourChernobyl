# 🚀 Tour to Chernobyl

Welcome to my repository for the <strong>Tour to Chernobyl</strong> project! This project was created as part of my studies in the <em>Advance CSS</em> course on Udemy, and it serves as a repository for the site I built during the course.

## 🌎 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to store the Tour to Chernobyl project so I can use its components in future projects or share it with recruiters when I decide to find work.

## 🖥️ Technology

The Tour to Chernobyl project was built using <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, without any <strong>JavaScript</strong> (as required by the course project specifications). In the course, I also learned how to use <strong>SASS</strong> to improve my CSS workflow.

## 💡 Features

Some notable features of this project include my improved understanding of CSS layout techniques, such as aligning content without using flex or grid layouts. I also learned how to use <code>clip-path</code> and <code>backface-visibility</code> for rotating items.

## 🚫 Limitations

It's important to note that this project is not yet fully responsive, and is currently designed for desktop screens only.

## 🔧 Installation

If you'd like to use this repository for your own projects, you can install the required SASS package by following the instructions in the included <code>package.json</code> file.

## 📝 License

This project is not subject to any licensing or usage restrictions.
