# 🚀 Tours to Chernobyl

Welcome to my repository for the <strong>Tours to Chernobyl</strong> project! This project was created as part of my studies in the <em>Advance CSS</em> course on Udemy, and it serves as a repository for the site I built during the course.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Tour to Chernobyl project showcases my front-end development skills and expertise in HTML, CSS, and SASS. It features innovative design elements and techniques that create a memorable user experience. The project also serves as a valuable tool for other developers and designers who are looking to learn more about front-end web development.


## 💻 Technology

The Tour to Chernobyl project was built using HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript (as per the requirements of the course). In order to improve the efficiency and organization of the CSS code, I also used SASS, a powerful CSS preprocessor that allows for the use of variables, mixins, and other advanced features.

Some of the key technologies and tools used in this project include:

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub

## 💡 Features

Some notable features of the Tours to Chernobyl project include:

- 🎨 A stunning visual design that incorporates striking imagery and typography to create a unique and immersive experience for users.
- 🎥 Effective use of CSS animation techniques, such as using <code>transform</code> and <code>transition</code> to create smooth and visually appealing animations for rotating images and other elements.
- 🔮 Innovative use of the <code>clip-path</code> property to create interesting and unusual shapes for various elements on the page, adding a distinctive and memorable touch to the site's design.
- 💪 Advanced layout techniques that demonstrate a deep understanding of CSS, including creative use of <code>float</code> and <code>position</code> to achieve precise and visually pleasing layouts without relying on modern CSS frameworks like Flexbox or Grid.
- 📦 A robust and well-organized SASS codebase, with well-structured stylesheets and efficient use of mixins and variables to keep the code concise and maintainable.


## 🚫 Limitations
